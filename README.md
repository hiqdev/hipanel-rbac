[HiPanel](http://hipanel.com/) is the next generation control panel for hosting, domains and more.

This package provides RBAC implementation for HiPanel:

- authorization data: roles and permissions
- helpers

## Installation

The preferred way to install this yii2-extension is through [composer](http://getcomposer.org/download/).

Either run

```sh
php composer.phar require "hiqdev/hipanel-rbac"
```

or add

```json
"hiqdev/hipanel-rbac": "*"
```

to the require section of your composer.json.

## Usage

To add a role or permission you need to write it to `src/files/tree.php`.
After adding roles you have to generate description to it by command:

    ./vendor/bin/hidev rbac/reinit

After these actions all rules are saved, and you need to check it by unit tests.
Run `./vendor/bin/phpunit` and correct `CheckAccessTrait` to fix errors.

### TypeScript tree file

`js/index.ts` file will be generated with all rbac console commands (`reinit, init, generate-descriptions`).
Also you can generate it with `generate-js` command.
